Run make_keys.py to generate client and server ssh keys, an authorized_keys file (allowing the client key), and a known_hosts file (containing the server key).

Run run_ade.py to start the AmpDateEcho server.

Run run_slave.py AS ROOT to connect as a slave to the server. Currently the slave
code has to be run as root in order to have enough permission to allocate PTYs
and start shell sessions (Are you a bad enough dude to fix this?).

Then attempt to ssh to the ADE server using openssh client such as:

    ssh -p 4422 -i ./client_id_rsa <TICKET>@localhost

Where <TICKET> is replaced by the ticket printed in the server log for the slave connection.

So long as the ticket you use is current and valid, it should proxy you, and spawn a reverse shell through the slave client's existing connection.

Try out the ampdate.py and ampecho.py scripts for hitting the Date and Echo commands on the AMP-over-SSH server.

Note: if you see strange errors like this in your server log:

exceptions.TypeError: ('Could not adapt', <twisted.conch.avatar.ConchUser instance at 0x864b3ac>, <InterfaceClass twisted.conch.interfaces.ISession>)

It most likely means you tried to shell in to the server using a username that was NOT a current and valid Ticket, and your client was denied trying to spawn a shell.

Have fun, and let me know solutions you come up with using this ! :)
